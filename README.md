# 🌱 Crop Disease Classification in Uganda 🚜  

## 🌟 Project Overview
In this project, you'll work with a dataset of **crop disease images** from Uganda. 🌍 Your goal is to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images into **five categories**. 🖼️ Along the way, you'll learn how to improve the performance of your computer vision model by leveraging **pre-trained models** and optimizing training with advanced techniques like **Callbacks**. 🛠️  

**Key Components**:

1. **Image Processing**:
   - Learn how to read and prepare image files for machine learning tasks.

2. **Neural Network Models**:
   - Use PyTorch to manipulate tensors and build neural network models.
   - Construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for image classification tasks.

3. **Model Predictions**:
   - Apply the trained model to make predictions on new images.
   - Classify images into various categories based on the presence of different animals.

4. **Competition Submission**:
   - Learn how to turn model predictions into a submission for the competition, ensuring your solutions meet the competition's requirements.

**Skills and Knowledge Gained**:

- 🔍 **Explore and analyze a crop disease image dataset**  
- 🧠 **Build and train a CNN to classify images into five disease categories**  
- 🚀 **Enhance your model using Transfer Learning with a pre-trained image classification model**  
- 🛑 **Identify and address model overfitting**  
- 📊 **Evaluate model performance using k-fold cross-validation**  
- ⏱️ **Utilize Callbacks like Learning Rate Scheduling, Checkpointing, and Early Stopping to optimize training**  

This project is a great opportunity to apply **deep learning techniques** to a real-world problem, helping farmers in Uganda detect and manage crop diseases effectively! 🌾🤖
